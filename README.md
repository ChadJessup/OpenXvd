OpenXvd
=======

This is a open source XVD Mounting program just to help people that are interested in the process of mounting a unencrypted XVD.

This is a cmd tool so it is best to build it, then run it in a cmd line with the command

OpenXvd -m "filepath" to mount and
OpenXvd -um "filepath" to unmount

For debugging this program in visual studio you can go into the project settings->Debugging->Command Line Arguments
In there you can add either -m "filepath" or -um "filepath"
